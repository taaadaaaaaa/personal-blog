            <p>I have spent my entire precious time in high school playing basketball with my friends, even when the weather is scorching hot, freezing cold, heavy rain, etc. So, it helps me to have lots of memorable times about my tricksy youth.</p>
            <p>Mastering something has never been easy. Winning is not the biggest achievement, the biggest prize is how you feel when you play it.</p>

            <p>Since I was a kid, I want to contribute my efforts to raise the living standard of the community, especially for special people, such as the elderly, the disabled, children, etc. However, growing up, I was inspired by fascinating technological movies when human kindness existed. At that time, I suddenly thought, what would be happened if I combine it?</p>
